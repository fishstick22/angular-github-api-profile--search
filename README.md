## GitHub Profile Search

One of the "Learn Angular 2 Development By Building 12 Apps" - Eduonix, Brad Traversy... applications.  Uses the GitHub API to search and display Profiles

The sample code provided in the for-pay course includes this MIT license file, so I am assuming it is ok to store my working version on public git repo (if not, just please ask and I will take it down)

Once building this tutorial app using the course samples and instructions, re-implemented using a starter

using @qdouble [Angular Webpack2 Starter bootstrap branch] (https://github.com/qdouble/angular-webpack2-starter/tree/bootstrap)

Also going to tweak the impementation a bit to learn more not covered in the course

* how to externalize the API authorization tokens generated by registering [OAuth applicaton](https://github.com/settings/applications/532505) so they are not embedded in the source code and can be kept out of the repository, etc
* build intgrated testing
* how to deploy to a "producton" env
* sure I will think of more and keep this list updated

### Externalize credentials

Moved the client id/secret constants out of the github.service.ts file into a github.secrets.json file 

'''
{
    "username": "xxx",
    "client_id": "xxxxx",
    "client_secret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
'''

although the service itself is not that secure as the id/secret is passed in the clear on the get querystring parameters.
